# Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression?

*       => Expression
'hello' => Value
-87.8   => Value
-       => Expression
/       => Expression
+       => Expression

# Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?

A string is a datatype which stores sequence of characters, numbers or special charater within quotes. Variable is a name used to store different values. A variable can store values like string, int, float, etc.

# Q3. Describe different data types?

Numeric       => Numeric data types include integers(e.g. 5, 7, -9), floating-point numbers(e.g. 3.14, -0.5, 6.0), and complex numbers(a + bj). Numeric data types are used for mathematical operations.
Sequence Type => The sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allow storing of multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. Sequence data type include String, List, and Tuple.
Boolean       => The Boolean data type holds the binary values True and False. It is used for logical operations, such as checking conditions or controlling program flow.
Set           =>  Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
Dictionary    => A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, separated by commas. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. The keys in a dictionary must be unique, and they are used to access the corresponding values.

# Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. Expressions perform some computation and return a value based on that computation.

# Q5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value, while a statement is a line of code that performs some action.

# Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Answer is 23

# Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

'spam' + 'spamspam' => 'spamspamspam'
'spam' * 3  => spamspamspam

# Q8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

The variable name should start with an alphabet. That's why eggs is a valid name whereas 100 is not a valid name.

# Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

To convert a value to an integer, you can use the int() function. To convert a value to a floating-point number, you can use the float() function. To convert a value to a string, you can use the str() function.

# Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

This expression causes error because 99 is an integer and we can't concatenate an integer with string. To fix this we need to convert 99 to string using str(). Final expression in 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
