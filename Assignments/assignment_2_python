# Q1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans. The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False.

# Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. The three different types of Boolean operators are and, or, and not(i.e. !).

# Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans. 

A	      B	    A and B
True	True	True
True	False	False
False	True	False
False	False	False

A	     B	    A or B
True	True	True
True	False	True
False	True	True
False	False	False

 A	    !A
True	False
False	True

# Q4. What are the values of the following expressions?
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) returns False
    not (5 > 4) returns False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) returns True
    [not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) returns False
    [(True and True) and (True == False) returns False
    (not False) or (not True) returns True

# Q5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans. The six comparison operators are ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

# Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one?
Ans. The = is an assignment operator used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The == is a comparison operator used to compare two values.

# Q7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
Ans.
 spam = 0
 if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
 if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
 else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
# Q8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam?
Ans. 
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')


# Q9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans. The key is Ctrl + C.

# Q10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans. Break statement terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop whereas continue statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

# Q11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans. The only difference is of representation. Otherwise range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) do the same thing i.e. generating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9.

# Q12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans. 
    # Using a for loop
        for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)

    # Using a while loop
        i = 1
        while i <= 10:
            print(i)
            i += 1

# Q13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans. We can call it by spam.bacon().
