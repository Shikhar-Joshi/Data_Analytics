# Q5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
Ans. Here's a basic example of how you might write this program:
import os
import shutil

def copy_files(src_folder, dst_folder, extension):
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(src_folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            if filename.endswith(extension):
                shutil.copy(os.path.join(foldername, filename), dst_folder)

# Call the function with paramters
copy_files_with_extension(src_folder, dst_folder, '.pdf') # change '.pdf' with required extension
