# Q1. What does RGBA stand for?
Ans. RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. While RGB is used to define colors, the 'Alpha' indicates the opacity level of the color.

# Q2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
Ans. You can get the RGBA values of an image in the Pillow module using the 'convert' method with 'RGBA' as the argument on an Image object.

# Q3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
Ans. A box tuple is a tuple of four integer coordinates that represent a rectangular region in an image. The four integers are as follows: (left, top, right, bottom).

# Q4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?
Ans. We can find out the width and height of an Image object using the 'size' attribute, which returns a tuple in the form (width, height).

# Q5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
Ans. We would call the 'crop' method on the Image object. We would need to pass a box tuple that defines the area to be cropped, which in this case would be (0, 0, 100, 50).

# Q6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
Ans. We can save it as an image file using the 'save' method, passing the desired filename as the argument.

# Q7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
Ans. Pillow's shape-drawing code is contained in the 'ImageDraw' module.

# Q8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?
Ans. 'ImageDraw' objects have drawing methods. You can get an 'ImageDraw' object by calling the 'Draw' function from the 'ImageDraw' module and passing your image as an argument.
